    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hey there! I’m a third-year software development student who’s basically
      living in the Matrix—except instead of dodging bullets, I’m dodging bugs
      in my code. I’m in my third year of this wild ride called a degree, where
      I’ve learned that coffee is my best friend and a semicolon can make or
      break my entire day. If you need someone to turn caffeine into code, I’m
      your guy!
    </p>

    <p>
      When I’m not tangled up in code or chasing down a rogue bug, I’m usually
      glued to my controller, either tearing up the virtual pitch in FIFA or
      living my best (or worst) life in Rockstar’s masterpieces like GTA and Red
      Dead Redemption 2. In FIFA, I’m all about outsmarting my opponents with a
      killer strategy—though I’ll admit I’ve been known to lose it when the ref
      makes a call that’s clearly nonsense. Then there’s GTA, where I’m either
      pulling off heists or accidentally turning a quiet drive into a five-star
      chaos fest. And don’t get me started on Red Dead Redemption 2—nothing
      beats riding through the Wild West, making tough choices, and soaking in
      that jaw-dropping story. Gaming’s my escape, sure, but it’s also where I
      sharpen my skills: quick thinking, problem-solving, and staying cool under
      pressure. Honestly, scoring a last-minute winner or surviving a shootout
      feels a lot like fixing a crashing program—pure adrenaline!
    </p>

      Back in the day, I was a hardcore bookworm, tearing through crime and
      detective novels like it was my job—especially anything by the queen of
      mysteries, Enid Blyton. I’d hunker down with The Famous Five or The Secret
      Seven, piecing together clues and trying to solve the case before the
      characters did (spoiler: I was usually right). I’d even risk the “go to
      bed” lecture, sneaking a flashlight under the covers to finish just one
      more chapter. Nowadays, my reading’s more Ctrl+F through documentation
      than flipping pages, but that detective spirit? It’s alive and well. All
      those hours with Enid Blyton turned me into a problem-solving
      machine—whether it’s hunting down a sneaky bug or unraveling a logic
      puzzle in my code, I’m still channeling that kid who wouldn’t rest until
      the mystery was solved.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, whether I’m bending it like Beckham in FIFA, living life on the edge
      in GTA, or channeling my inner outlaw in Red Dead Redemption 2, I’m always
      leveling up—both in-game and in my coding journey. I’m on a mission to
      make the digital world a better place, one line of code at a time, even if
      it means surviving on energy drinks and sheer stubbornness. Stick around—I
      might just build something cool!
